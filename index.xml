      <description>There have been many opinions and critiques on how states have handled the covid pandemic. Florida has been was slow to enact restrictions and quick to loosen them. My state New Mexico was quick to enact restrictions and slow to release, if fact we are still required to wear masks in public. How do we know if these actions were the right actions to take.
There are many variables to consider but one way to determine if a state is being successful is to compare the deaths and death rates from covid relation to the ranking of population.</description>
